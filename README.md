# CS3TextDecompiler
 THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
 
 This is a tool I'm currently writing that is meant to decompile scenario files from CS3/CS4. From what I've seen there is no such tool available and this is why I am making it.
 Unfortunately the code is not really pretty since I'm still a beginner; any advice or contribution is welcome!! (contact: feitaishi45@gmail.com)
 
 I don't intend to find the exact type of each operande for each OP code in the files. The main purpose of this tool is to allow extraction/insertion of text to help translating those games in other languages than English.
 
# Why QT?
I wanted to use Qt for the QXlsx library https://github.com/QtExcel/QXlsx which I believe is the most feature-complete library existing for XLSX file creation. I want to be able to customize the sheets as much as possible (even though I might not do it soon)

# Status
Currently there is still a LOT to be done. Insertion is not developped yet, and many OP Codes are missing. Decompiling "m3040.dat" should be fine with this code but I need to verify it. Anyway, you can expect some improvements in the coming days.
